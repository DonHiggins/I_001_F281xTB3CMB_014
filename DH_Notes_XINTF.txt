XINTF

1. play with the programmable wait states

You specify the set-up/hold and access wait states for each XINTF zone by
configuring the associated XTIMINGx registers.

2. Understand clocking issues

The access timing is based
on an internal clock called XTIMCLK. XTIMCLK can be set to the same rate
as the SYSCLKOUT (which is the CPU clock)
 or to one-half of SYSCLKOUT. The rate of XTIMCLK applies
to all of the XINTF zones. XINTF bus cycles begin on the rising edge of
XCLKOUT and all timings and events are generated with respect to the rising
edge of XTIMCLK.

SYSCLKOUT (CPU clock) -> XTIMCLK -> XCLKOUT

Use XTIMCLK bit in the XINTFCNF2 register to set XTIMCLK = 1/2 SYSCLKOUT
the CLKMODE bit in the XINTFCNF2 refister to set XCLKOUT = 1/2 XTIMCLK

3. Write Buffering

By default, write access buffering is disabled. In most cases, to improve performance
of the XINTF, you should enable write buffering. Up to three writes to
the XINTF can be buffered without stalling the CPU. The write buffer depth is
configured in the XINTCNF2 register.
